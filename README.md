# golin

Golin is an approach to create a microservice that allows multiple services to use authentication without needing to implement it.

The project uses JWT as a way of securing the comunication bewteen the client and the login server. 

Interfaces and some abstractions were made to make it as generic as possible, this could be changed to use some configuration files or changing the login methods.
